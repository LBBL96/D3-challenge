          <p class = "text-left">Studies of health risks in the United States have shown a high correlation between poverty
              and obesity, researchers said on Monday. "We believe that the health risks associated with poverty include obesity
              because unhealthy food is less expensive and more accessible to the poor than healthy alternatives," said Joe Bleaux,
              lead researcher at the Centers for Disease Control. "Unfortunately, the excessive caloric intake associated with these foods
              has associated health issues, including a lower life span." While life expectancy rates were not released with 
              the research, Bleaux and his colleagues made data available that includes median age by state in the U.S.

          <p>Mississippi leads the nation in poverty percentage, at 21.5 percent, and is third in the nation in obesity, at
            35.5 percent. Obesity is not exclusive to poverty. New Hampshire, which has the nation's lowest poverty level (9.2%), 
            is more than 27 percent obese. Colorado has the lowest obesity rate, 21.3%. In every American state, more than one-fifth
            of all residents are obese. Often the rate is closer to one-third.</p>

          <p>Not surprisingly, household income is correlated with obesity -- the richer you are, the less likely you are to be obese.
            Mississippi households have the nation's lowest income, $39,680. In Maryland, where the household median income is 
            $73,971, obesity drops to 29.6%. In states where household income exceeds $65,000, fewer than 30 percent of residents
            are obese. Obesity rates steadily decrease as household income increases; for every $5,000 increase in household income,
            the corresponding obesity rate decreases between one and two percent.
